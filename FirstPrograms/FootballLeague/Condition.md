Football tournament
The SoftUni team organized a football tournament. Initially we read from the console the capacity of the stadium and the number of all fans. Then for each fan the sector they are in is read. The first team's fans are in sector A and B, and the second team's fans are in C and D. Write a program that calculates the percentages of fans in each sector, relative to the total number of fans in the stadium, and the total percentage of fans for both teams, relative to the capacity of the stadium. The total number of fans does NOT exceed the capacity of the stadium.
