Logistics
You are responsible for the logistics of various cargo. Depending on the weight of the cargo, a different vehicle is needed. The price per ton for which the cargo is transported is different for each vehicle:
Up to 3 tonnes - minibus (200 BGN per tonne)
From 4 to 11 tonnes - truck (175 leva per tonne)
12 tonnes and more - train (120 leva per tonne)
Your task is to calculate the average cost per tonne of freight carried, and the percentage of tonnes carried by each vehicle, relative to the total weight (in tonnes) of all freight.

A series of numbers are read from the console, each on a separate line:
On the first line - the number of loads to be transported - an integer in the range [1...1000]
For each load on a separate line - the tonnage of the load - an integer in the range [1...1000]
Output
Print 4 rows on the console as follows:
First line - the average price per ton of freight (rounded to the second decimal place);
Second line - the percentage of tons transported by van (percentage between 0.00% and 100.00%);
Third line - the percentage of tons transported by truck (percentage between 0.00% and 100.00%);
Fourth row - the percentage of tonnes transported by train (percentage between 0.00% and 100.00%).
